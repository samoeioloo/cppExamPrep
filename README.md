Examples on various CPP topics

A file serving as practical revision to a practical C++ course.

### 1. Topics in each file, can be separated by a namespace.
### 2. Add more topics or examples by forking repo and making a PR.
### 3. Feel free to open issues on potential bugs.
### 4. makefile contains targets compiling and running files independently. There is a make all target that compiles and runs all the files. This is done for simplicity as managing header files would have been a nightmare and additional code signatures to write.
